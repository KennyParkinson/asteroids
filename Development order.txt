Development order
	develop individual 				systems
	rendering, particle systems
input
networking
data persistence

develop game systems first, then game code


MILESTONES:
	1. move the ship, wraps 		around, renders
	2. objects moving, 			  collisions, projectiles, particles
	3.AI

game code
	physics?
	ai
	input
	scoring
	object updates (movement)

-----------------------------
game engine/systems
	particle framework
	audio
	collisions
		Here's the objects, tell 			me what collided.

Particle framework
array of particle systems

ai
particle systems
collision detection
	create a list for each object type, then test the ones that need to see if they collide

server runs the game model and sends the updates to the clients

score persistence on the server
audio
	explosions
	background music
	menu navigation
	ship sounds
